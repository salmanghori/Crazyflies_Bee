This repository implements motion-capture-based control and demonstration frameworks for Crazyflie drones using Qualisys (QTM), Python, and MATLAB. Real-time 6-DoF pose (and optional marker) data from QTM are streamed to Python and injected into the Crazyflie onboard EKF via external position or pose updates, enabling stable flight using the high-level commander (HL) or closed-loop velocity control.

The codebase includes HL-only open-loop swarm demos (hover, square, segmented figure-8) and a beat-synchronized drone music show, where beat timestamps are read from a CSV, audio is played via pygame, and synchronized HL go_to commands—optionally phase-shifted per drone—are scheduled to align precisely with musical beats. In parallel, a closed-loop pipeline demonstrates real-time MATLAB-in-the-loop control over UDP, executing smooth, rate-limited velocity commands with safety handling, logging, and a complementary example of preplanned polynomial trajectory execution.
